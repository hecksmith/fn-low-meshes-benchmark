# Fortnite "Low Meshes" Benchmark

Source data for this benchmark, captured using FRAPS Benchmark:

 - Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/qbhpcl/indepth_low_meshes_benchmarks_on_mediumhigh_spec/
 - YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj590Amr7dQ

## Conversion to Metrics

In the benchmark video I use the following metrics:

- 0.1% Low - `PERCENTILE(<data-range>, 0.001)`
- 1% Low - `PERCENTILE(<data-range>. 0.01)`
- Average/Median - `MEDIAN(<data-range>)`

Am important thing to be aware of is that what I show here as "0.1% low" and "1% low" are just simple/straight "percentile" stats.

This is not what all other benchmark publishers do, there is some debate/variation in that area - See the "x% low" section of: [CapFrameX - Explanation of different performance metrics](https://www.capframex.com/blog/post/Explanation%20of%20different%20performance%20metrics)
